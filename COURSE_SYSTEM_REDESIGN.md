# 🎓 Course System Redesign - Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Backend Changes

### 1. Course Model Updates (`backend/models/Course.js`)
Added new fields to support standalone courses:
```javascript
courseImage: String        // Teacher can upload course image
zoomLink: String          // Zoom meeting link
materialLinks: [{         // Array of course materials
  title: String,
  url: String,
  type: enum['zoom', 'document', 'video', 'other']
}]
announcement: String      // Course announcements (e.g., "Live class today at 3 PM")
```

### 2. Enrollment System (`backend/routes/courses.js`)

**✅ POST /api/courses/:courseId/enroll**
- Students can enroll in courses
- Adds student to both `students` and `enrolledStudents` arrays
- Prevents duplicate enrollments
- Returns success message

**✅ GET /api/courses/:id** (Updated)
- Teachers see everything
- Enrolled students see all materials (Zoom links, documents, announcements)
- Non-enrolled students see:
  - Course title, description, image
  - Enroll button
  - Hidden: materialLinks, zoomLink, detailed announcements

**✅ POST /api/courses** (Ready for new fields)
- Accepts: `courseImage`, `zoomLink`, `materialLinks`, `announcement`
- Auto-sets `createdBy` and `instructor` to teacher

## 💡 Implementation Notes

1. **Image Handling:** Currently expects URL. Could add file upload later.
2. **Zoom Links:** Validate URL format on frontend
3. **Material Links:** Allow teachers to add/remove dynamically
4. **Announcements:** Support markdown or rich text in future
5. **Labs:** Remain completely separate from courses

**All backend code is ready and deployed!** Frontend UI updates needed next.
