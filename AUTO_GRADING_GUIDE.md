# ü§ñ Auto-Grading System Guide

## Overview

Your Virtual Lab LMS now has an **Instant Auto-Grading System** that combines **Rule-Based** and **Rubric-Based** grading methods. This provides fast, fair, and accurate grading without requiring AI APIs.

---

## üéØ How It Works

### **Rule-Based Grading (50 points)**
Validates scientific/mathematical correctness:
- Checks if numerical values match expected results
- Validates calculations (e.g., V = I √ó R for Ohm's Law)
- Ensures values are within acceptable tolerance ranges

### **Rubric-Based Grading (50 points)**
Evaluates report quality and completeness:
- Checks for required sections (Results, Observations, Analysis)
- Awards points for including relevant keywords
- Ensures minimum content length requirements

---

## üìö Available Templates

### 1. **Ohm's Law Lab**
- Validates: voltage, current, resistance values
- Keywords: proportional, linear, ohm, resistance, circuit
- Perfect for: Electronics and physics labs

### 2. **Chemistry Lab**
- Validates: pH, molarity, temperature values
- Keywords: acid, base, neutralization, titration, indicator
- Perfect for: Chemical reaction experiments

### 3. **Circuit Analysis Lab**
- Validates: total resistance, current, power dissipation
- Keywords: series, parallel, circuit, kirchhoff
- Perfect for: Complex circuit analysis

### 4. **Generic Lab Report**
- Focuses on report structure and completeness
- Sections: Introduction, Results, Discussion, Conclusion
- Perfect for: Any lab type

## üöÄ How to Use (Teacher)

### Step 1: Create Assignment with Auto-Grading

1. Go to **Teacher Dashboard**
2. Click **"Create Assignment"**
3. Fill in assignment details
4. **Enable "Instant Auto-Grading"** checkbox ‚úÖ
5. Select a grading template from dropdown
6. Click **"Create Assignment"**

```javascript
// Example: Ohm's Law Assignment with Auto-Grading
{
  title: "Ohm's Law Lab Assignment",
  autoGrade: true,  // Enable auto-grading
  gradingTemplate: "ohmsLaw",  // Use Ohm's Law template
  maxScore: 100
}
```

### Step 2: What Happens Next

- Students complete the virtual lab
- Students submit their lab report
- **System grades INSTANTLY** (< 1 second)
- Students see their score and detailed feedback immediately

---

## üë®‚Äçüéì How It Works (Student Experience)

### Step 1: Student Submits Report

```
Lab Results:
Voltage: 12V
Current: 3A
Resistance: 4Œ©

Observations:
I observed a linear relationship between voltage and current.
The current is proportional to the voltage when resistance is constant.

Analysis:
This validates Ohm's Law (V = I √ó R). The resistance remained constant.
```

### Step 2: Instant Grading (< 1 second)

```
üéâ Assignment Graded Instantly!

Score: 90/100 (A)

üåü Excellent work! Your calculations are accurate and your report is comprehensive.

Detailed Breakdown:
‚úì voltage: Correct (15/15)
‚úì current: Correct (15/15)
‚úì resistance: Correct (20/20)
‚úì Results: Present (10/10)
‚úì Observations: Present (15/15)
‚úì Keywords found: 4 (+8 points)
‚úó Analysis: Missing (0/15)
‚úì Sufficient detail (+5 points)

Rule-Based: 50/50
Report Quality: 38/50
```
